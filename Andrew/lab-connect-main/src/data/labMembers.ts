    projectDescription: 'Investigating CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing efficiency in mammalian cell lines for therapeutic applications.',
    previousUpdate: 'Completed transfection optimization for HEK293 cells with 85% efficiency.',
    recentUpdate: 'Successfully demonstrated targeted knock-out of BRCA1 gene in patient-derived organoids. Observed 92% editing efficiency with minimal off-target effects. Currently validating results with whole-genome sequencing.',
    wetLabExplanation: 'We used our CRISPR scissors to cut out a specific gene (BRCA1) in mini-organs grown from patient cells. The editing worked really well - 92% of cells got the edit we wanted, and we didn\'t accidentally cut anywhere else. We\'re now double-checking everything by reading all the DNA.',
    dryLabExplanation: 'The CRISPR-Cas9 system achieved 92% on-target editing efficiency for BRCA1 knockout in organoid models. Preliminary bioinformatics analysis suggests minimal off-target activity based on guide RNA specificity scores. WGS data will be processed through our variant calling pipeline for comprehensive validation.',

    recentUpdate: 'Trained new AlphaFold-inspired model on expanded dataset of 50,000 protein structures. Achieved 89% TM-score on CASP15 benchmark proteins. Model now predicts folding within 3 hours on single GPU.',
    wetLabExplanation: 'We built a computer program that can predict how proteins fold into their 3D shapes. It\'s like predicting how a long chain will naturally coil up. Our new version is much better - it gets the shape right almost 90% of the time, and it\'s fast enough that you could get results back the same day you run an experiment.',
    dryLabExplanation: 'The updated neural network achieves 89% TM-score on CASP15 targets, representing a 14% improvement over our previous architecture. The model leverages attention mechanisms for residue-residue contact prediction and runs inference in O(n²) time complexity. GPU memory optimization allows single-GPU deployment for sequences up to 2,000 residues.',

    recentUpdate: 'Peptide AMX-7 shows potent activity against MRSA biofilms with MIC of 2 μg/mL. No cytotoxicity observed in HepG2 cells at therapeutic concentrations. Beginning mouse model studies next week.',
    wetLabExplanation: 'We found a natural antibiotic (AMX-7) from bacteria living near underwater volcanoes that can kill drug-resistant staph infections, including the tough sticky films they form. It works at very low doses and doesn\'t harm human liver cells. We\'re about to test it in mice to see if it works in a living system.',
    dryLabExplanation: 'AMX-7 demonstrates a minimum inhibitory concentration of 2 μg/mL against MRSA biofilms, with selectivity index >50 based on HepG2 cytotoxicity assays. Structural analysis suggests amphipathic α-helical conformation enabling membrane disruption. Pharmacokinetic modeling will guide dosing for murine efficacy studies.',

    wetLabExplanation: 'We looked at the genetic activity of 15,000 individual immune cells (regulatory T cells). Found 8 different types, including a new one that makes a lot of IL-10 (an anti-inflammatory signal). We\'re writing up our findings now.',
    dryLabExplanation: 'scRNA-seq analysis of 15,000 Tregs revealed 8 transcriptionally distinct clusters via Seurat/Scanpy workflow.

    wetLabExplanation: 'We combined three types of data (proteins, genes, and metabolism) from 200 colon cancer patient samples. Found that certain tumors have a weakness - they rely heavily on a specific energy-making process. This means drugs like metformin might work well against them.',
    dryLabExplanation: 'Multi-omics integration pipeline processed 200 CRC samples across proteomics (TMT-MS), RNA-seq, and metabolomics platforms. Graph-based network analysis identified OXPHOS pathway enrichment (FDR < 0.001) specifically in MSI-high tumors. In silico drug screening suggests synthetic lethality with mitochondrial complex I inhibitors.',

    wetLabExplanation: 'We built a genetic "light switch" that can turn genes on or off using blue light. It\'s very sensitive (50x boost in production) and fast (works within 30 minutes). Now we\'re putting it into cancer-fighting immune cells so doctors could control when they release their attack signals.',
    dryLabExplanation: 'The optogenetic circuit demonstrates 50-fold dynamic range with t½ activation of ~30 minutes upon 470nm illumination. Spatial resolution achieved through focused LED arrays enables single-cell precision. Integration with CAR-T constructs will utilize inducible cytokine payloads for tunable immunotherapy.',
