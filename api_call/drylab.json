    "summary": "The wet lab has \"Completed RNA-seq QC\" (Ribonucleic acid sequencing Quality Control), meaning the raw sequencing data, which measures gene expression levels, has been checked for technical quality and integrity. They have also performed an \"initial differential expression analysis,\" which is a preliminary statistical comparison to identify genes with significant changes in expression between experimental groups. This initial data provides a foundational dataset for your computational modeling and pathway enrichment studies."
