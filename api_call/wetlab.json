    "summary": "The dry lab has finished checking the quality of the Ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-seq) data, meaning the raw gene expression measurements from your samples are reliable. This \"Completed RNA-seq QC\" step ensures the data is suitable for analysis. We have also performed an \"initial differential expression analysis,\" which is the first look at which genes show significant changes in activity between your experimental groups. This initial analysis could highlight specific genes or pathways for your further investigation."
